# ChompGame
According to Wikipedia: "Chomp is a two-player strategy game played on a rectangular grid made up of smaller square cells, which can be thought of as the blocks of a chocolate bar. The players take it in turns to choose one block and "eat it" (remove from the board), together with those that are below it and to its right. The top left block is "poisoned" and the player who eats this loses."

This is my first project using SFML libraries. I converted the project to SFML in a single day so it is on my TODO to clean that up a bit and make it look nice. The point of this project was mainly for me to learn how to use the SFML libraries.
